# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Course

In this repo, it contains the projects I worked on for the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Course on Udacity.  Each course is separated into directories.  For each directory, a clone from the relevant repo is made, followed by the necessary edits required to constitute a complete submission for that project.  You may consult each directory for the instructions for that particular project for more details.

## Project #1 - Simple Lane Finding Algorithm

This directory contains a method using simple computer vision algorithms to help localise where lanes are with respect to the ego vehicle.  Given sample images from the front camera of a car on a highway, we determine the left and right lanes for the car.  Please navigate to the `CarND-LaneLines-P1` directory for more details.  The report can be found in this directory under `reflection_report.md`.
